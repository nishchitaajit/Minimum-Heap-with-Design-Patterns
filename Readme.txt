Question 1) The tests from Assignment Ð 1 were checking just the insertion to the heap but the new tests are checking the way they are being added to the heap. The class from where we test these methods have also changed. The previous tests were not good enough for this assignment and I had to add more tests to validate the way the design patterns worked. Also I had to modify the previous tests.Question 8) Yes I was able to remove all other null checks including the tree height method.
